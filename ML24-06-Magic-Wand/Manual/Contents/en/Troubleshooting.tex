\section{Maintenance}

\subsection{Caring for the Magic Wand}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Do not spray water or any liquid directly onto the board. Any liquid that goes into the product may cause a failure, fire, or electric shock.
		\item To clean the wand, gently wipe away smudges and fingerprints on the stick with a micro-fiber cloth. Clean the body of the wand only with a micro-fiber cloth dampened with a small amount of water. After that, remove the moisture with a dry cloth. While cleaning, do not apply strong force to the board because it can damage the board. Only the wand body can be cleaned, not the board. Never use flammable liquids (benzene, thinner, etc.) or a cleaning agent. For stubborn smudges, spray a small amount of water on a micro-fiber cloth, and then use the cloth to wipe away the smudges.
