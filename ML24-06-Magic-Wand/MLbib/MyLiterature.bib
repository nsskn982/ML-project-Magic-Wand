	abstract     = {In this work, the energy-optimal motion planning problem for planar robot manipulators with two revolute joints is studied, in which the end-effector of the robot manipulator is constrained to pass through a set of waypoints, whose sequence is not predefined. This multi-goal motion planning problem has been solved as a mixed-integer optimal control problem in which, given the dynamic model of the robot manipulator, the initial and final configurations of the robot, and a set of waypoints inside the workspace of the manipulator, one has to find the control inputs, the sequence of waypoints with the corresponding passage times, and the resulting trajectory of the robot that minimizes the energy consumption during the motion. The presence of the waypoint constraints makes this optimal control problem particularly difficult to solve. The mixed-integer optimal control problem has been converted into a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem first making the unknown passage times through the waypoints part of the state, then introducing binary variables to enforce the constraint of passing once through each waypoint, and finally applying a fifth-degree Gauss--Lobatto direct collocation method to tackle the dynamic constraints. High-degree interpolation polynomials allow the number of variables of the problem to be reduced for a given numerical precision. The resulting mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem has been solved using a nonlinear programming-based branch-and-bound algorithm specifically tailored to the problem. The results of the numerical experiments have shown the effectiveness of the approach.}

	abstract     = {Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is an emerging low-power wireless technology developed for short-range control and monitoring applications that is expected to be incorporated into billions of devices in the next few years. This paper describes the main features of BLE, explores its potential applications, and investigates the impact of various critical parameters on its performance. BLE represents a trade-off between energy consumption, latency, piconet size, and throughput that mainly depends on parameters such as connInterval and connSlaveLatency. According to theoretical results, the lifetime of a BLE device powered by a coin cell battery ranges between 2.0 days and 14.1 years. The number of simultaneous slaves per master ranges between 2 and 5,917. The minimum latency for a master to obtain a sensor reading is 676 µs, although simulation results show that, under high bit error rate, average latency increases by up to three orders of magnitude. The paper provides experimental results that complement the theoretical and simulation findings, and indicates implementation constraints that may reduce BLE performance.}

The novel use of Machine Learning algorithms, extensive training of the model, on dataset built using real world conditions, enhances the output accuracy of the model, which gives the model the capabilities to take decisions on its own and thus create a self-sustainable ecosystem, harnessing advanced technologies, without any human involvement.

This device consists of Arduino UNO, LCD 16×2 I2C, MQ-8 H2 gas sensor, MQ-135 CO2 gas sensor, BH1750 light sensor, and DHT11 temperature sensor. The concentration of waste is 5–30 mg/L with variations range of 5 mg/L. Meanwhile, the neural network architecture was created using the MATLAB R2018a application. The architecture that owned 25 neurons was chosen due to its performance value with an error of $3.98 \times {10}^{ - 25}$ and epoch 165. The result of artificial neural network (ANN) training on MATLAB of 4-25-1 architecture contains an error value of 0.024%. The weight and bias values in the training process are programming ANN to Arduino. The testing has an error value of 6.028% and a root-mean-square error of 0.552. Based on the error values, it shows that the training is reaching close to the actual value, it can be concluded that the device can work properly and is practical to use because it does not take long to observe.},

Weather stations measure weather data consisting of temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, light intensity, and others. An online service that provides weather data, one of which is OpenWeatherMap. Weather data from OpenWeatherMap in this study was implemented in a room using an instrumentation system, so that the weather conditions in the room are in accordance with the weather data conditions obtained from OpenWeatherMap. To validate between weather data in a room obtained through sensors against weather data obtained from OpenWeatherMap, the data is processed in a microcontroller. The sensor module used consists of a DHT22 sensor to measure temperature and humidity, a BMP180 sensor to measure pressure and wind speed, and a BH1750 sensor to measure light intensity. To get the same weather data conditions between weather data in a room and weather data obtained from OpenWeatherMap, use an actuator that functions as a weather conditioner in a room. The actuators used consist of heaters and coolers to produce temperature, water spray to produce humidity, fans to produce wind speed, and light bulbs to produce light intensity. The results of this study are prototype weather conditioners in a room based on weather data in a city obtained from OpenWeatherMap.},

	abstract     = {Hydroponics is a farming method that makes efficient use of both space and land. Growing plants hydroponically requires consideration of pH, nutrition, water regulation, and light sources. The latter two can be managed using pumps and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), respectively; which require electrical energy. This research investigated hydroponics and electrical energy consumption concerns for prototype design, implementation, testing, and analysis with a framework of fuzzy logic and the Internet of Things (IoT). This work employed BH1750, SEN0244 TDS, PH-4502C, ACS712, and 170640 sensors for temperature, illuminance, nutrition, pH, electric current, and voltage sensing, respectively. The control parts were an Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller board, ESP8266 NodeMCU, and DS3231 RTC, and the output parts were the growing light LEDs, LCD, DC water, and peristaltic pumps. Swamp cabbage plant samples were utilized for three comparative prototypes: fuzzy-based, schedule-based, and natural methods. The testing was conducted for 36 days. The results showed that the typical plant height difference between the fuzzy-based and natural methods was 1.75 cm (26.3%) and that of the schedule-based and natural methods was 1.28 cm (22.8%). Furthermore, the typical plant growth rates were 0.50 cm/day, 0.44 cm/day, and 0.32 cm/day for the fuzzy-based, schedule-based, and natural methods, respectively. Moreover, consumed energy savings with the fuzzy-based versus schedule-based methods was 49.11 Wh (4.75%), 49.02 Wh (4.75%), or 48.99 Wh (4.74%) using ordinary, Simpson’s composite rule, or trapezoidal composite rule computation methods, respectively. The fuzzy-based method undoubtedly increased the plant’s height and growth rate, while requiring energy consumption that was less than that of the schedule-based method.},
