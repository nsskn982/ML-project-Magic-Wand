\chapter{Sketch}

\section{Components Required}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense
	\item LiPo Battery (or AAA with Boost Converter)
	\item RGB LED / NeoPixel
	\item Vibration Motor (optional)
	\item Push Button (optional)
	\item Thin Copper Wire
	\item Wand Casing (Wooden or 3D-Printed)
\end{itemize}

\section{Assembly Plan}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Mount the Arduino securely inside the wand near the grip.
	\item Connect the battery and voltage regulator (if needed).
	\item Place RGB LEDs at the tip and route wires through the wand.
	\item Attach a vibration motor near the grip (optional for haptic feedback).
	\item Install a button on the side for user interaction (optional).
	\item Manage the wires using thin insulated cables for a compact fit.
	\item Secure the components with glue or 3D-printed holders inside the wand.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Circuit Diagram}
The basic wiring schematic is shown below:

The magic wand is assembled with motion-based interaction and LED effects using the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense. Further programming can be done to integrate spell recognition through gesture sensing.
