\chapter{Pandas}

	\section{Introduction}
	
	Pandas is a powerful and popular open-source data analysis and manipulation library for Python. It provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools, making it highly efficient for working with structured data, such as spreadsheets, SQL tables, and time series data.
	
	This report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Pandas package, including its description, installation process, and several examples demonstrating its usage in different scenarios. Additionally, further reading resources will be suggested for those interested in diving deeper into the Pandas library \cite{McKinney:2012}. 
	
	The version of the Pandas package used here is 1.4.4. This package is used in the project to load the data from CSV files, transform the data (e.g. handle missing values), add columns, and etc. All these functions of the Pandas package are explained in the upcoming sections.
	
	\section{Description}
	
	Pandas is a powerful and popular open-source data analysis and manipulation library for Python. It provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools, making it highly efficient for working with structured data, such as spreadsheets, SQL tables, and time series data.
	
	At its core, Pandas introduces two primary data structures: Series and DataFrame. 
	
	\begin{itemize}
		
		\item Series is a one-dimensional labeled array that can hold any data type. It is similar to a column in a spreadsheet or a database table and can be accessed using labels or positions. With Series, data can be efficiently manipulated and analyzed, enabling tasks such as filtering, aggregation, and transformation \cite{McKinney:2012}.
		
		\item DataFrame, on the other hand, is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. It can be thought of as a tabular data structure, similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table. DataFrames provide a rich set of operations, such as indexing, merging, reshaping, and grouping, allowing for extensive data manipulation and analysis capabilities.
		
	\end{itemize}
	
	Pandas offers a wide range of functionalities, including data cleaning, transformation, filtering, merging, reshaping, and visualization. It provides tools for handling missing data, working with time series data, and performing statistical operations. With its intuitive and expressive syntax, Pandas simplifies data manipulation tasks and accelerates the data analysis process \cite{McKinney:2012}.
	
	Furthermore, Pandas seamlessly integrates with other popular Python libraries, such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn, making it an essential tool in the data science and analytics ecosystem. Its versatility, efficiency, and extensive documentation make it a preferred choice for data professionals, researchers, and analysts working with structured data in Python.

	\subsection{Data Suitability}
	
	Pandas is highly compatible with various types of data.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		
		\item \textbf{Data Structure:} Pandas primarily works with two main data structures: Series and DataFrame. Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type, while DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure resembling a table or spreadsheet. Ensure that your data is organized in a structure that can be represented by these data structures for effective usage with Pandas.
		
		\item \textbf{Data Format:} Pandas supports various data formats, including CSV, Excel, SQL databases, JSON, HTML,HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format),Parquet, Feather, and more. Ensure that your data is in a compatible format that can be easily read and loaded into Pandas. Additionally, Pandas provides functions to read and write data in different formats, allowing you to seamlessly work with different types of data sources.
		
		\item \textbf{Data Size:} Consider the size of your data when working with Pandas. While Pandas can handle large datasets, excessively large datasets may result in performance issues or memory constraints. If you have a large dataset, you may need to optimize your code, use appropriate data types, or consider using alternative tools like \textbf{Dask} or \textbf{Apache Spark} for distributed computing.
		
		\item \textbf{Performance Considerations:} Depending on the size and complexity of your data, certain operations in Pandas may be more computationally expensive. It is essential to optimize your code and leverage Pandas' built-in vectorized operations and efficient indexing techniques to achieve better performance.
		
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Key Features of Pandas}
	
	Pandas excels in the following areas \cite{pandas:2021}:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		
		\item Easy management of missing data (represented as NaN) in both floating point and non-floating point data.
		
		\item Size mutability, allowing the insertion and deletion of columns from DataFrame and higher-dimensional objects.
		
		\item Automatic and explicit data alignment, enabling explicit alignment of objects to a set of labels or automatic alignment by Series, DataFrame, etc. during computations.
		
		\item Powerful and flexible group by functionality, facilitating split-apply-combine operations on data sets for both aggregation and transformation.
		
		\item Seamless conversion of ragged and differently-indexed data from other Python and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects.
		
		\item Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets.
		
		\item Intuitive merging and joining of data sets.
		
		\item Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets.
		
		\item Hierarchical labeling of axes, allowing the presence of multiple labels per tick.
		
		\item Robust I/O tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited formats), Excel files, databases, and efficient saving/loading of data in the HDF5 format.
		
		\item Time series-specific functionality, including date range generation, frequency conversion, moving window statistics, date shifting, and lagging.
		
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Why Multiple Data Structures in Pandas?}
	
	Pandas employs multiple data structures for a specific purpose. It is best to view pandas data structures as flexible containers for lower-dimensional data. For instance, DataFrame acts as a container for Series, and Series acts as a container for scalars. This allows us to insert and remove objects from these containers in a manner similar to dictionaries \cite{McKinney:2015}.
	
	Additionally, pandas provides sensible default behaviors for common API functions, considering the typical orientation of time series and cross-sectional data sets. When using N-dimensional arrays (ndarrays) to store 2- and 3-dimensional data, it burdens the user to consider the data set's orientation while writing functions. In pandas, the axes are designed to impart more semantic meaning to the data. For a given data set, there is usually a preferred orientation. The objective is to reduce the mental effort required to code data transformations in downstream functions \cite{McKinney:2012}.
	
	For example, when dealing with tabular data (DataFrame), it is more semantically helpful to think in terms of the index (representing rows) and the columns, rather than axis 0 and axis 1. Iterating through the columns of a DataFrame results in more readable code:

	\begin{code}[h!]
	\lstinputlisting[language=Python,style=pythonstyle , numbers=none, linerange={30-32}]{Code/Pandas/Pandas.py}    
	
	\caption{Columns of DataFrame}
	
   	\end{code}

	\section{Installation}
	
	Installing pandas as a component of the cross-platform Anaconda distribution, which is used for data analysis and scientific computing, is the simplest way to do so. For the majority of users, this installation technique is advised.
	
	\subsection{Python version support}
	
	Pandas officially supports a range of Python versions, including Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11.
	
	\subsection{Installing with Anaconda}
	
	For less experienced users, installing pandas and the rest of the NumPy and SciPy stack can be challenging.
	With Anaconda, a cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows) Python distribution for data analytics and scientific computing, it is easy to install not only pandas, but Python and the most well-known tools that make up the SciPy stack (IPython, NumPy, Matplotlib,...) as well.
	After launching the installer, the user won't need to install anything else or wait for any software to compile in order to utilize pandas and the rest of the SciPy stack.


	\subsection{Installing using terminal or command prompt}
	
	To install Pandas, you can use the Python package manager, pip, by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
	
		\begin{code}[h!]
			\lstinputlisting[language=Python, numbers=none, linerange={34-35}]{Code/Pandas/Pandas.py}    
			
			\caption{Installing Pandas using terminal}
			
		\end{code}	
	
	Ensure that you have a compatible version of Python installed on your system before running the installation command.
	
	\subsection{Required dependencies}

	\subsection{Pandas Error Handling}
	
	Pandas provides various error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions and errors that may occur during data manipulation and analysis. These error handling techniques help in diagnosing and addressing issues that arise when working with data in Pandas. Some common error handling techniques in Pandas include:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Try-Except Blocks:} You can use standard Python try-except blocks to catch and handle specific exceptions that may occur during Pandas operations. For example, you can wrap a Pandas function call within a try block and use except blocks to handle specific exceptions, such as \texttt{ValueError} or \texttt{KeyError}, and perform appropriate error handling actions.
		
			\begin{code}[h!]
			\lstinputlisting[language=Python,style=pythonstyle , numbers=none, linerange={121-130}]{Code/Pandas/Pandas.py}    
			
			\caption{Try Except Blocks}
			
			\end{code}
		
	\item \textbf{Error Reporting:} Pandas provides descriptive error messages that provide information about the nature of the error and the location where it occurred. These error messages can be useful for diagnosing and debugging issues in the data or the code. When an error occurs, Pandas displays an error message along with a traceback that helps identify the source of the error.
	
	\item \textbf{Error Handling Functions:} Pandas provides specific functions to handle errors and exceptions. For example, the \texttt{pd.options.mode} function allows you to set error handling modes, such as \texttt{raise} to raise exceptions for errors, \texttt{warn} to display warning messages instead of raising exceptions, and \texttt{ignore} to ignore errors and proceed with the operation.
	
		\begin{code}[h!]
		\lstinputlisting[language=Python,style=pythonstyle , numbers=none, linerange={132-140}]{Code/Pandas/Pandas.py}    
		
		\caption{Error Handling Functions}
		
	\end{code}
	
	\item \textbf{Error Handling with DataFrame and Series:} Pandas provides methods and properties for error handling specific to DataFrame and Series objects. For example, the \texttt{.at} and \texttt{.iat} attributes allow for safe access and assignment of scalar values, raising exceptions if the provided index is not found. The \texttt{.get()} method allows retrieving values with a default value, avoiding exceptions when the key is not found.
	
	\begin{code}[h!]
		\lstinputlisting[language=Python,style=pythonstyle , numbers=none, linerange={142-150}]{Code/Pandas/Pandas.py}    
		
		\caption{Error Handling with DataFrame and Series}

	\end{code}
	
	\end{enumerate}
	
	By leveraging these error handling techniques, you can effectively handle exceptions and errors that may arise during data operations in Pandas, ensuring smooth data processing and analysis.
