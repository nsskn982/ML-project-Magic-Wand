\section*{Introduction to Keras}

	Keras and TensorFlow are among the most widely adopted frameworks in deep learning, each offering distinct strengths and capabilities.\cite{Jsaer:2024} Keras, initially introduced as a high-level API for neural network development, is renowned for its simplicity and user-friendly design, enabling researchers and developers to prototype and build sophisticated models with minimal code. Supporting multiple backends, including TensorFlow, Theano, and Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK), Keras provides flexibility and ease of integration.\cite{Jsaer:2024} On the other hand, TensorFlow, developed by the Google Brain team, is a robust and versatile framework that offers a comprehensive suite of tools for designing, training, optimizing, and deploying machine learning models.\cite{Jsaer:2024} With both high-level and low-level APIs, TensorFlow caters to a wide range of applications, from exploratory research to large-scale production systems, and includes an extensive ecosystem with tools like TensorFlow Extended (TFX), TensorFlow Lite, and TensorFlow Serving.\cite{Jsaer:2024}
	
	The integration of Keras as the official high-level API for TensorFlow combines the simplicity of Keras with the power and scalability of TensorFlow, providing a unified and seamless environment for deep learning development and deployment.\cite{Jsaer:2024} This paper provides an in-depth review of Keras and TensorFlow, highlighting their features, capabilities, and applications. We begin by discussing the evolution of deep learning frameworks and the contributions of Keras and TensorFlow in advancing the field. Next, we examine related studies that compare these frameworks and their applications, followed by a detailed methodology for evaluating their performance and capabilities.\cite{Jsaer:2024}

\section*{Description of Keras}
	Keras is an open-source, high-level neural networks API written in Python, designed to facilitate fast experimentation and efficient model development in deep learning. Initially developed as an interface for TensorFlow, it now supports multiple backends, including TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch. Keras emphasizes ease of use with a clean, human-centric API, enabling developers to quickly build and train models with minimal code. It also promotes rapid debugging, code elegance, and performance optimization, while being highly deployable across various platforms. Keras models are scalable and can be used in both research and industrial applications, with widespread adoption in organizations like CERN, NASA, and NIH.\cite{Jsaer:2024}
	
	\subsection*{Understanding the Structure of Keras}
	At the core of Keras are several essential components that together create the framework’s structural integrity. Understanding these components is crucial for effective utilization of Keras, as they play pivotal roles in the model-building process.\cite{Jsaer:2024}
	
	\subsection*{Models}
	In Keras, models are abstractions that represent neural network architectures. There are two primary types of models in Keras:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Sequential Model:} A linear stack of layers, suitable for simple feedforward networks and problems with a uniform sequence of layers.
		\item \textbf{Functional API:} Allows for the creation of complex architectures with shared layers, multiple inputs, and multiple outputs, catering to advanced use cases like multi-task learning.\cite{Keras:2024}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection*{Layers}
	Layers are the building blocks of any neural network, and Keras provides a variety of pre-built layers to accommodate different functions:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Dense Layers:} Fully connected layers that apply linear transformations, crucial for fully connected network architectures.
		\item \textbf{Convolutional Layers:} Used for image processing tasks, enabling the network to learn spatial hierarchies from images.
		\item \textbf{Recurrent Layers:} Designed for sequence data, ideal for tasks such as natural language processing (NLP).\cite{Keras:2024}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection*{Activations}
	Activation functions define the output of each layer in a network, injecting non-linearity into the model. Common activation functions include:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{ReLU:} Mitigates the vanishing gradient problem, widely used in hidden layers.
		\item \textbf{Sigmoid:} Maps predictions to probabilities between 0 and 1, ideal for binary classification tasks.
		\item \textbf{Softmax:} Used in the output layer for multi-class classification problems.\cite{Keras:2024}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection*{Training and Evaluation in Keras}
	\subsection*{The Compile Method}
	The \texttt{compile} method specifies the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics. Popular optimizers include:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Adam:} Combines the benefits of both RMSprop and SGD.
		\item \textbf{RMSprop:} Suitable for recurrent neural networks.
		\item \textbf{SGD:} Effective in convergence with large datasets.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection*{The Fit Method}
	The \texttt{fit} method trains the model using backpropagation and gradient descent. Users can specify:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Batch size
		\item Number of epochs
		\item Validation data
	\end{itemize}
	Callbacks, such as early stopping, can be implemented for enhanced training strategies.
	
	\subsection*{Model Evaluation and Prediction}
	Post-training, the \texttt{evaluate} method quantifies the model’s performance on unseen data, while the \texttt{predict} method generates predictions for new inputs.\cite{Keras:2024}

			Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
			])
			
			# Compile the model
			model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
			
			print("Model created successfully.")
		\end{lstlisting}
	\end{itemize}
	
	If the script runs without errors, Keras is functioning correctly.

		\end{lstlisting}
		This generates a C array from the TensorFlow Lite model that can be included in your Arduino project.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\subsection{How to import}
	\subsubsection{Installation}
	
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
		
		pip install keras	
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	\subsubsection{Getting Started}
	Once Keras is installed, you can import it in your Python scripts or interactive sessions:
	
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={Example of gesture data with sensor readings}, label={code:gesture-data-json}, style=pythonstyle]
	import keras
\end{lstlisting}
	
	\subsubsection{Creating a Sequential Model}
	
	Keras provides a Sequential model API for building neural networks layer-by-layer. Here's an example of how to create a simple Sequential model with Keras:
	
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={Example of a neural network model with Keras}, label={code:keras-model-example}, style=pythonstyle]
	from keras.models import Sequential
	from keras.layers import Dense
	
	# Initialize the model
	model = Sequential()
	
	# Add layers to the model
	model.add(Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)))
	model.add(Dense(units=10, activation='softmax'))
	
	# Compile the model
	model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
	optimizer='sgd',
	metrics=['accuracy'])
\end{lstlisting}
	
	\subsubsection{Training the Model}
	
	Once the model is defined, you can train it on your data. Here's an example of how to train the model:
	
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={Training the Keras model}, label={code:keras-model-training}, style=pythonstyle]
	# Assuming X_train and y_train are your training data
	model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
\end{lstlisting}
	
	\subsection{Run a Pre-trained Example}
	
	To further verify your setup, use a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model from the TensorFlow repository. Deploy it on your target device and confirm that it produces the expected output.
	
	
	\subsubsection{Evaluating the Model}
	
	After training, you can evaluate the performance of the model on your test data:
	
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={Evaluating the Keras model}, label={code:keras-model-evaluation}, style=pythonstyle]
	# Assuming X_test and y_test are your test data
	loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
	print("Test Loss:", loss)
	print("Test Accuracy:", accuracy)
\end{lstlisting}
	
	
	For a detailed guide covering in-depth usage of different parts of the Keras API, you can refer to the Keras developer guides. These guides are deep-dives into specific topics such as layer subclassing, fine-tuning, or model saving.
	
	\subsection{Important attributes of keras}

		\item \textbf{Integration}: Keras seamlessly integrates with other popular Python libraries and frameworks, such as TensorFlow and scikit-learn. This allows for easy interoperability and integration into existing workflows and projects.
		
		\item \textbf{Community and Documentation}: Keras has a large and active community of developers and users who contribute to its development and provide support. The official documentation is comprehensive and includes tutorials, guides, and API references to help users get started and learn more about Keras.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	These attributes make Keras a powerful and versatile tool for building and training neural networks for a wide range of applications, including the Magic Wand project with the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense.
	
	\section{Example - Version}
	The version information for Keras can be retrieved programmatically within Python environment.
	
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={Getting the version of Keras}, label={code:keras-version}, style=pythonstyle]
	import keras
	
	# Get the version of Keras
	keras_version = keras.__version__
	
	# Print the version
	print("Keras Version:", keras_version)
\end{lstlisting}
	
	You can run this code in your Python environment to print out the version of Keras that you have installed. This information can be useful for ensuring compatibility and understanding which features are available in your Keras installation for your Magic Wand project with the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense.\cite{Keras:2024}
	
	
	\subsection{updating the version of Keras in Python}
	
	To update the version of Keras in Python, you can use the pip package manager. Here are the steps:
	
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Open your command line or terminal.

	\end{lstlisting}
		
		
		This command will upgrade the Keras package to the latest version available on the Python Package Index (PyPI).
		
		\item Once the upgrade is complete, you can verify the updated version by running:
		
	\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={Check the version of Keras using Python}, label={code:check-keras-version}, style=pythonstyle]
		python -c "import keras; print(keras.__version__)"
	\end{lstlisting}
		
		
		This command will print out the version of Keras installed in your Python environment, confirming that the update was successful.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	By following these steps, you can ensure that you have the latest version of Keras installed.
	
	
	\section{Example}
	This document demonstrates how to use TensorFlow Lite with the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense. Specifically, it uses data from the \texttt{LSM9DS1} accelerometer to classify gestures or motion using a simple TensorFlow model.
	
	\subsection{Step 1: Create and Compile a Keras Model}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Create and Compile a Keras Model:}
		\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Creating a Keras Model}, label={code:create-keras-model}, style=pythonstyle]
			import tensorflow as tf
			from tensorflow.keras import Sequential
			from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
			import numpy as np
			
			# Example training data: Accelerometer data (X, Y, Z)
			train_data = np.array([[0.1, 0.2, 0.3], [0.4, 0.5, 0.6], [0.7, 0.8, 0.9]])  # Example accelerometer data
			labels = np.array([0, 1, 0])  # Example labels for classification (gesture class)
			
			# Create a simple model for classification
			model = Sequential([
			Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(3,)),  # 3 input features (X, Y, Z)
			Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # Binary output (gesture class 0 or 1)
			])
			
			# Compile the model
			model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
			
			# Train the model
			model.fit(train_data, labels, epochs=10)
			
			# Convert the model to TensorFlow Lite format
			converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
			tflite_model = converter.convert()
			
			# Save the model as a .tflite file
			with open("model.tflite", "wb") as f:
			f.write(tflite_model)
			
			print("Model converted to TensorFlow Lite successfully.")
		\end{lstlisting}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Step 2: Convert the Model to C Array}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Convert the Model to C Array:}
		\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Converting the Model to C Array}, label={code:convert-to-c-array}, style=pythonstyle]
			xxd -i model.tflite > model.cc
		\end{lstlisting}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Step 3: Arduino Code to Run the TensorFlow Lite Model}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Arduino Code to Run the TensorFlow Lite Model:}
		\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Arduino Code to Run the TensorFlow Lite Model}, label={code:arduino-tflite}, style=pythonstyle]
			#include <Arduino.h>
			#include <TensorFlowLite.h>
			#include <Wire.h>
			#include <LSM9DS1.h>
			
			// Include the generated C array from the TensorFlow Lite model
			extern "C" {
				#include "model.cc"
			}
			
			// Instantiate the LSM9DS1 sensor object
			LSM9DS1 imu;
			
			// Define the TensorFlow Lite interpreter and model
			tflite::MicroInterpreter* interpreter;
			tflite::Model* model;
			tflite::MicroAllocator* micro_allocator;
			tflite::MicroInterpreter* micro_interpreter;
			
			void setup() {
				Serial.begin(9600);
				Wire.begin();
				
				// Initialize the IMU sensor (LSM9DS1)
				if (!imu.begin()) {
					Serial.println("Failed to initialize IMU sensor!");
					while (1);
				}
				
				// Load the TensorFlow Lite model
				model = tflite::GetModel(model_tflite);
				interpreter = tflite::MicroInterpreter(model, micro_allocator, tflite::kTensorArenaSize);
				
				Serial.println("Setup complete!");
			}
			
			void loop() {
				// Read accelerometer data from LSM9DS1 sensor
				imu.readAccel();
				float x = imu.accelX();
				float y = imu.accelY();
				float z = imu.accelZ();
				
				// Prepare the input tensor (accelerometer data)
				float input_data[] = {x, y, z};
				float* input = interpreter->input(0)->data.f;
				for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
					input[i] = input_data[i];
				}
				
				// Invoke the model to make predictions
				interpreter->Invoke();
				
				// Get the output tensor
				float* output = interpreter->output(0)->data.f;
				
				// Display the predicted output
				if (output[0] > 0.5) {
					Serial.println("Gesture Class: 1");
				} else {
					Serial.println("Gesture Class: 0");
				}
				
				delay(500);  // Delay before the next prediction
			}
		\end{lstlisting}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Reshaping and Flattening}
	Reshaping and flattening operations are essential when preparing data for neural network models. 
	
	\textbf{Reshaping with \texttt{tf.reshape()}}: The \texttt{tf.reshape()} function allows you to change the shape of a tensor without changing its data. This is particularly useful when the input data needs to be reshaped to fit the input requirements of the model.
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Reshaping a Tensor}, label={code:reshape}, style=pythonstyle]
		import tensorflow as tf
		
		# Create a tensor with shape (4, 3)
		tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]])
		
		# Reshape the tensor to shape (2, 6)
		reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(tensor, (2, 6))
		print(reshaped_tensor)
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	\textbf{Flattening with the \texttt{Flatten()} Layer}: In convolutional neural networks, the output of convolutional layers is often a multi-dimensional tensor. The \texttt{Flatten} layer is used to convert this tensor into a one-dimensional vector suitable for dense layers.
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Flattening a Tensor}, label={code:flatten}, style=pythonstyle]
		from tensorflow.keras.layers import Flatten
		
		# Example input tensor of shape (batch_size, height, width, channels)
		input_tensor = tf.random.normal([32, 64, 64, 3])  # Batch of 32 images, 64x64 pixels, 3 color channels
		
		flattened_tensor = Flatten()(input_tensor)
		print(flattened_tensor.shape)  # Output shape will be (32, 64*64*3)
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	\subsection{Stacking and Splitting Arrays}
	Handling multiple input or output arrays can be managed with \texttt{tf.stack()} and \texttt{tf.split()}.
	
	\textbf{Stacking Arrays with \texttt{tf.stack()}}: The \texttt{tf.stack()} function stacks a list of tensors along a new axis.
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Stacking Arrays}, label={code:stack}, style=pythonstyle]
		import tensorflow as tf
		
		# Two 1D tensors
		tensor_a = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])
		tensor_b = tf.constant([4, 5, 6])
		
		# Stack the tensors along the first axis
		stacked_tensor = tf.stack([tensor_a, tensor_b])
		print(stacked_tensor)
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	\textbf{Splitting Arrays with \texttt{tf.split()}}: The \texttt{tf.split()} function splits a tensor into smaller tensors along a specified axis.
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Splitting Arrays}, label={code:split}, style=pythonstyle]
		import tensorflow as tf
		
		# A 1D tensor
		tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
		
		# Split the tensor into 3 parts along the first axis
		split_tensors = tf.split(tensor, 3)
		print(split_tensors)
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	\section{Managing Keras Versions}
	
	\subsection{Check Installed Version}
	To check the version of Keras installed in your environment, use the following command:
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Check Installed Keras Version}, label={code:check-keras}, style=pythonstyle]
		pip show keras
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	This command will display the installed version of Keras, along with other package information.
	
	\subsection{Upgrade to the Latest Version}
	To ensure you have the latest version of Keras installed, use the following command:
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Upgrade Keras}, label={code:upgrade-keras}, style=pythonstyle]
		pip install --upgrade keras
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	This will upgrade your installation to the latest version.
	
	\section{File Interaction: Saving and Loading Models}
	
	\subsection{Saving Models}
	To save a trained Keras model, use the \texttt{model.save()} method. This stores the model's architecture, weights, and training configuration in a file.
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Saving a Keras Model}, label={code:save-model}, style=pythonstyle]
		# Save the trained model to a file
		model.save('model.h5')
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	\subsection{Loading Models}
	To reload a saved model, use \texttt{tf.keras.models.load\_model()}:
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Loading a Keras Model}, label={code:load-model}, style=pythonstyle]
		from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
		
		# Load the model from the .h5 file
		model = load_model('model.h5')
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	\section{Error Handling}
	
	\subsection{Common Issue: "Model size exceeds memory on microcontroller."}
	This issue occurs when the size of the TensorFlow model exceeds the available memory of a microcontroller. The solution to this problem is to quantize the model using TensorFlow Lite's post-training quantization.
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Post-Training Quantization}, label={code:quantization}, style=pythonstyle]
		import tensorflow as tf
		
		# Convert the model to TensorFlow Lite format
		converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
		
		# Apply post-training quantization
		converter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]
		tflite_model = converter.convert()
		
		# Save the quantized model
		with open('quantized_model.tflite', 'wb') as f:
		f.write(tflite_model)
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	This reduces the model size and makes it more suitable for microcontroller deployment.
	
	\subsection{Common Issue: "Incompatible Keras version."}
	Incompatibility between Keras and TensorFlow versions can lead to errors. To resolve this, ensure that the versions of Keras and TensorFlow you are using are compatible.
	
	1. Uninstall the current versions of Keras and TensorFlow:
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Uninstall Keras and TensorFlow}, label={code:uninstall-tensorflow}, style=pythonstyle]
		pip uninstall keras tensorflow
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	2. Install compatible versions:
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Install Compatible Versions}, label={code:install-tensorflow}, style=pythonstyle]
		pip install tensorflow
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	Alternatively, for specific versions:
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Install Specific Version of Keras}, label={code:install-keras}, style=pythonstyle]
		pip install keras==2.9.0
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	\section{Example- Files}
	
	\subsection{Saving a Model}
	Keras provides a simple way to save both the architecture and weights of a trained model, allowing you to load it later for inference or further training.
	
	To save a model in Keras, use the \texttt{model.save()} method:
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Saving a Keras Model}, label={code:save-model}, style=pythonstyle]
		from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
		from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
		
		# Define a simple model
		model = Sequential([
		Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
		Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
		])
		
		# Compile the model
		model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
		
		# Save the model to a file (HDF5 format)
		model.save('my_model.h5')
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	\subsection{Loading a Saved Model}
	To load a previously saved model, use the \texttt{load\_model()} function from \texttt{tensorflow.keras.models}:
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Loading a Keras Model}, label={code:load-model}, style=pythonstyle]
		from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
		
		# Load the model from the file
		model = load_model('my_model.h5')
		
		# Use the model for predictions or further training
		predictions = model.predict(input_data)
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	\subsection{Saving Only Model Weights}
	If you only want to save the weights (not the entire model), you can use the \texttt{save\_weights()} method:
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Saving Only Model Weights}, label={code:save-weights}, style=pythonstyle]
		# Save the model weights
		model.save_weights('my_model_weights.h5')
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	To load the weights back into a model:
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Loading Model Weights}, label={code:load-weights}, style=pythonstyle]
		# Load the model structure
		model = load_model('my_model_structure.h5')
		
		# Load the weights into the model
		model.load_weights('my_model_weights.h5')
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	\subsection{Saving and Loading Training Data}
	
	\subsection{Saving Data to a CSV File}
	Suppose you have training data in a NumPy array and want to save it to a CSV file. You can use \texttt{numpy.savetxt()}:
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Saving Data to a CSV File}, label={code:save-csv}, style=pythonstyle]
		import numpy as np
		
		# Sample data: 100 samples with 5 features each
		data = np.random.random((100, 5))
		
		# Save the data to a CSV file
		np.savetxt('training_data.csv', data, delimiter=',')
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	\subsection{Loading Data from a CSV File}
	To load data back from a CSV file, you can use \texttt{numpy.loadtxt()} or \texttt{pandas.read\_csv()} (if you prefer using pandas for convenience):
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Loading Data from a CSV File}, label={code:load-csv}, style=pythonstyle]
		import numpy as np
		
		# Load the data from the CSV file
		data = np.loadtxt('training_data.csv', delimiter=',')
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	Alternatively, using pandas for loading the CSV:
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Loading Data with Pandas}, label={code:load-pandas}, style=pythonstyle]
		import pandas as pd
		
		# Load the data into a DataFrame
		data = pd.read_csv('training_data.csv', header=None)
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	\subsection{Saving Data to HDF5}
	If you want to store large datasets efficiently, consider using the HDF5 format. You can use the \texttt{h5py} library to save and load data in HDF5 format:
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Saving Data to HDF5}, label={code:save-hdf5}, style=pythonstyle]
		import h5py
		
		# Create a sample dataset
		data = np.random.random((100, 5))
		
		# Save the data to an HDF5 file
		with h5py.File('data.h5', 'w') as f:
		f.create_dataset('dataset', data=data)
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	\subsection{Loading Data from HDF5}
	To load data from an HDF5 file, use \texttt{h5py.File}:
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Loading Data from HDF5}, label={code:load-hdf5}, style=pythonstyle]
		import h5py
		
		# Load the data from the HDF5 file
		with h5py.File('data.h5', 'r') as f:
		data = f['dataset'][:]
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	\subsection{Processing Image Files for Keras}
	
	Keras offers utility functions for loading and processing image data, especially for tasks like classification. The \texttt{ImageDataGenerator} class provides real-time data augmentation and loading from directories.
	
	\subsection{Loading and Processing Images with \texttt{ImageDataGenerator}}
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Loading and Processing Images}, label={code:image-gen}, style=pythonstyle]
		from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
		
		# Define an ImageDataGenerator for real-time augmentation
		datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
		rescale=1./255,  # Normalize the images to [0, 1]
		rotation_range=40,  # Randomly rotate images
		width_shift_range=0.2,  # Randomly shift images horizontally
		height_shift_range=0.2,  # Randomly shift images vertically
		shear_range=0.2,  # Random shear transformations
		zoom_range=0.2,  # Random zoom
		horizontal_flip=True,  # Randomly flip images horizontally
		fill_mode='nearest'  # Fill missing pixels after transformations
		)
		
		# Load images from a directory
		train_generator = datagen.flow_from_directory(
		'path_to_train_data',  # Path to the training images
		target_size=(150, 150),  # Resize images to 150x150
		batch_size=32,
		class_mode='binary'  # Binary labels (for binary classification)
		)
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	\subsection{Saving Processed Image Data}
	
	While you typically don't save processed image data in the same way as model weights, you can save transformed images if needed. You can save them using \texttt{ImageDataGenerator} or \texttt{PIL}:
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Saving Processed Image Data}, label={code:save-image}, style=pythonstyle]
		from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import img_to_array, array_to_img
		from PIL import Image
		
		# Example: Save a transformed image
		img = Image.open('image.jpg')
		img_array = img_to_array(img)
		
		# Perform some transformation (example: flipping)
		img_array = np.fliplr(img_array)
		
		# Convert back to image and save
		img_processed = array_to_img(img_array)
		img_processed.save('flipped_image.jpg')
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	\subsection{Saving and Loading Text Data}
	
	If you're working with text data, such as in natural language processing (NLP), you can save and load data using standard text file handling methods.
	
	\subsection{Saving Text Data to a File}
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Saving Text Data to a File}, label={code:save-text}, style=pythonstyle]
		text_data = ["This is an example sentence.", "This is another example."]
		
		# Save the text data to a text file
		with open('text_data.txt', 'w') as f:
		for line in text_data:
		f.write(line + "\n")
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	\subsection{Loading Text Data from a File}
	
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Loading Text Data from a File}, label={code:load-text}, style=pythonstyle]
		# Load the text data from a file
		with open('text_data.txt', 'r') as f:
		text_data = f.readlines()
		
		# Remove newline characters
		text_data = [line.strip() for line in text_data]
	\end{lstlisting}
