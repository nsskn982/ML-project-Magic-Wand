\chapter{Built-inLED}\index{LED!Built-in LED}

Some Arduino boards have a LED on board which can use for the application. \cite{ArduinoNanoGetStarted:2024,Arduino:2023a,Arduino:2023}

\section{General Information}

LEDs are used in the applications. Depending on the action performed by a user or the sketch, corresponding feedback can be provided. This can take the form of the LED switching on, switching off or flashing. \cite{Kurniawan:2021b}




\section{Built-in LED}

The built-in LED of the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense is a single orange LED that is connected to pin 13 on the board. The built-in LED is active-high, which means that setting the pin to \PYTHON{HIGH} will turn the LED on, and setting the pin to \PYTHON{LOW} will turn the LED off. The built-in LED can be used for various purposes, such as indicating the status of the board, displaying sensor data, creating visual effects, or debugging. \cite{Arduino:2023a,Arduino:2023,ArduinoNano33Manual:2022}

\section{Specification}

\subsection{Pin Assignment}

The built-in LED is a orange LED and connected to pin 13.\index{Pin!Pin 13} The brightness can not be controlled. \cite{Arduino:2023a,Arduino:2023}

\begin{description}
    \item [Built-in LED:] \PYTHON{LED\_BUILTIN =  13u}
\end{description}

Built-in LED is active-high and connected to pin 13.

The built-in LED can be controlled programmatically by setting the pin to \PYTHON{HIGH} or \PYTHON{LOW}. 


%\Mynote{cite data sheet, power consumption?}

The pin 13 must be defined as an output in the function \PYTHON{setup} by setting \PYTHON{pinMode (13, OUTPUT)}, otherwise the LED cannot be switched on.

\medskip 


The pin 13 can also be used otherwise. Then the LED is not in use.

%\Mynote{What happen if there is another LED at the pin? Both in use?}


\subsection{Power Comsumption}

The power comsumption has to be considered. It is the same value as for the power LED, see section~\ref{LEDPowerComsumption}.

\section{Simple Code}

\subsection{Simple Code for the Built-in LED}

For using the built-in LED, a simple library is introduced here.

\medskip


In the header file \FILE{BuiltinLED.h}, see code \ref{Nano:BuiltinLEDHeader}, are the declaration of the variables and the  functions. A variable is connected to pin 13.\index{Pin!Pin 13} The pin 13 is defined as an output in the function \PYTHON{BuiltinLEDinit}. There are  2 functions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \PYTHON{BuiltinLEDinit}: This funtion initializes the digital pin 13 of the built-in LED as an output.
    \item \PYTHON{BuiltinLED}: This funtion switches the built-in LED  on or off.
\end{enumerate}

{
    \captionof{code}{Header file without comments for using the Built-in LED}\label{Nano:BultinLEDHeader}
    \ArduinoExternal{linerange={9-14,27-28,40-42}}{../../Code/Nano33BLESense/LEDs/BuiltinLED.h}
}

In the file \FILE{BuiltinLED.cpp}, see code \ref{Nano:BuiltinLEDCpp}, the functions are implemented.

{
  \captionof{code}{Code file without comments for using the Built-in LED}\label{Nano:BuiltinLEDCpp}
  \ArduinoExternal{linerange={12-15,28-34,46-51}}{../../Code/Nano33BLESense/LEDs/builtinLED.cpp}
}


\subsection{Simple Code for Testing the Built-in LED}

In the sketch \ref{Nano:BuiltinLEDTest}, a variable is connected to pin 13.\index{Pin!Pin 13} The pin is defined as an output in the function \PYTHON{setup}. In the function \PYTHON{loop}, the LED is switched on for 1 second and switched off for 1 second so that the LED flashes accordingly.



{
  \captionof{code}{Simple sketch without comments to control the built-in LED}\label{Nano:BuiltinLEDTest}
  \ArduinoExternal{linerange={17-19,31-34,47-57}}{../../Code/Nano33BLESense/Test/TestLEDBuiltin.ino}
}

\bigskip

This is just a simple example. The variable \PYTHON{LED\_BUILTIN} is already defined, so the assignment is not necessary. The command \PYTHON{delay} should be avoided in an Arduino sketch. Instead, variables of the type \PYTHON{elapsedMillis} should be used.

%\Mynote{Arduino Referenz \url{https://github.com/pfeerick/elapsedMillis/wiki}}

\section{Tests}

\subsection{Simple Function Test}

The simplest test is the flashing of the LED at 2 Hz, see sketch \ref{Nano:BuiltinLEDTest2}.

{
  \captionof{code}{Simple sketch to test the built-in LED}\label{Nano:BuiltinLEDTest2}
  \ArduinoExternal{linerange={17-19,31-34,47-57}}{../../Code/Nano33BLESense/Test/TestLEDBuiltin.ino}
}


\subsection{Test all Functions}

As the built-in does not allow any special manipulations, all functions are covered with the sketch \ref{Nano:BuiltinLEDTest2}.

\section{Simple Application}

In many applications, it is necessary to save power so that the LED is not switched on continuously. Nevertheless, feedback is required as to whether the system, e.g. a fire detector, is switched on and functional. In this case, the LED is switched on for 1 second at a defined time interval, in this case 30 seconds. This is implemented in the example \ref{Nano:TestBuiltinApp}.
