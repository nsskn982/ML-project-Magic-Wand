*
*  @brief Example code for using the pressure sensor LPS22HB with the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board.
*	
*
*  
*  @details We include the necessary libraries: Wire.h for I2C communication and LPS22HB.h for the sensor LPS22HB.
*  We create an instance of the class LPS22HB called lps.
*  In the function setup(), we initialize the serial communication at 9600 baud and start the I2C bus.
*  We call the function begin() on the lps instance to initialize the sensor.
*  In the function loop(), we read the pressure and temperature data using the readPressure() and readTemperature() functions, respectively.
*  We print the data to the serial monitor using Serial.print() and Serial.println().
*  We add a delay of 1 second to update the data every second.
*  
*  Note:
*  
*  Make sure to connect the sensor LPS22HB to the board Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense correctly.
*  This example assumes that the sensor is calibrated and ready to use.
*  You can modify the code to suit your specific needs, such as changing the update rate or adding more functionality.
*  
*  Tips:
*  
*  Use the function Wire.begin() to initialize the I2C bus before using the  class LPS22HB.
*  Use the function lps.begin() to initialize the sensor before reading data.
*  Use the function delay()  to add a delay between readings, or use a timer to update the data at a specific interval.
